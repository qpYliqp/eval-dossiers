## Introduction

MonMasterUB is a comprehensive web application designed to streamline the management of master programs, student evaluations, and data verification processes for educational institutions. This application allows administrators and examiners to create and manage master program spaces, upload evaluation files, map data fields between different file formats, validate candidate information, and update student records efficiently.

The system helps bridge the gap between university-specific data (PV files) and standardized MonMaster formats, making evaluation processes more streamlined and accurate.

## Installation

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system
2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://gitlab.emi.u-bordeaux.fr/pfe2025/evaldossiers.git
   cd evaldossiers
   ```
3. Start the application using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
4. Access the application at `http://localhost:4200`


## Getting Started

After installation, follow these steps to get started with MonMasterUB:

1. **Access the Application**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200`
2. **Create a Master Program Space**: Click on "Ajouter un espace" to create your first program space
3. **Upload Files**: Select your newly created master program and upload relevant MonMaster and PV files
4. **Map Data Fields**: Create mappings between MonMaster and university-specific data fields
5. **Validate Candidates**: Process and validate candidate information
6. **Review and Update Data**: Make any necessary updates to candidate information

## Key Features

### Master Program Spaces

The Master Program Spaces feature allows you to create and manage different program spaces for various master's degrees offered by your institution.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Create new master program spaces
- Manage existing master programs
- Add examiners to master programs
- View program details and statistics

### File Upload and Management

This feature enables you to upload and manage various file types associated with your master programs, primarily MonMaster and PV (university-specific) files.

**Supported File Types:**
- MonMaster formatted files
- University PV (Proc√®s-Verbal) files
- Various document formats (XLSX, XML, PDF etc.)

### Data Mapping

The Data Mapping functionality allows you to create field mappings between MonMaster standardized formats and your institution's specific data formats (PV files).

**Benefits:**
- Create one-to-one field mappings
- Standardize data across different sources
- Save mapping configurations for reuse
- Reduce manual data entry errors

### Candidate Validation

The Candidate Validation feature helps you verify and validate candidate information across different data sources.

**Validation Levels:**
- Fully Verified: All candidate information matches across sources
- Partially Verified: Some information matches, but discrepancies exist
- Cannot Verify: Insufficient information to validate the candidate
- Potential Fraud: Significant discrepancies requiring investigation

### Data Updates

This feature allows you to view and update candidate information as needed.

**Update Capabilities:**
- Personal information (name, contact details)
- Academic records
- Scores and evaluations
- Supporting documentation

## User Guide

### Managing Master Programs

#### Creating a New Master Program
1. From the main dashboard, click "Ajouter un espace"
2. Fill in the required information:
   - Master Name (e.g., "Master Informatique")
   - Academic Unit (e.g., "UF Informatique")
3. Click "Submit" to create the master program

#### Adding Examiners (coming soon)
1. Select a master program from the dashboard
2. Click on "View Examiners" to see the current examiners
3. Click "Ajouter un examinateur" to add a new examiner
4. Select the examiner from the dropdown list
5. Click "Submit" to add the examiner

#### Managing Master Programs
- **Edit**: Click the edit icon on a master program card to modify its details
- **Delete**: Click the delete icon to remove a master program (confirmation required)
- **Navigate**: Use the context menu (three dots) to access specific features:
  - File System: Manage files for this master program
  - Mapping System: Create and manage data mappings
  - Data Verification: Validate candidate information

### Uploading Files

1. Navigate to the Files section for a specific master program
2. Choose the file type you wish to upload (MonMaster or PV)
3. Drag and drop your file or click to browse
4. Fill in the required metadata:
   - University Name
   - Academic Unit
   - Academic Year
   - Session (if applicable)
5. Click "Upload" to process the file

### Creating Data Mappings

1. Navigate to the Mapping section for a specific master program
2. If no files are selected, choose the relevant MonMaster and PV files
3. Once files are loaded, you will see three panels:
   - MonMaster Fields (left)
   - Current Mappings (center)
   - PV Fields (right)
4. To create a new mapping:
   - Click "Ajouter un mapping"
   - Select a field from the MonMaster list
   - Select a corresponding field from the PV list
   - Click "Enregistrer" to save the mapping
5. To delete a mapping, click the delete icon next to that mapping

### Validating Candidates

1. Navigate to the Validation section for a specific master program
2. Click "Commencer la validation" to start the validation process
3. The system will process and compare candidate data from different sources
4. Once complete, review the results in the table:
   - Green rows: Fully verified candidates
   - Yellow rows: Partially verified candidates
   - Red rows: Potential fraud cases
   - Blue rows: Cannot verify (insufficient information)
5. Use the filter option to show only verified candidates if needed
6. For detailed review:
   - Click the "Review" button to see detailed comparison
   - Click the "Edit" button to update candidate information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Application Not Loading

- Check if the correct ports (3000 for API, 4200 for frontend) are available
- Clear browser cache and refresh the page

#### File Upload Failures
- Verify the file is in a supported format
- Check file size (max 10MB recommended)
- Ensure all required metadata fields are completed

#### Mapping Issues
- Ensure both MonMaster and PV files are successfully uploaded
- Check that column headers in the files are consistent and readable
- Clear any previous incomplete mapping attempts
- Restart the mapping process if encountering persistent errors

#### Validation Process Stalling
- The validation process can take several minutes for large datasets
- Ensure the system has completed all mapping operations before validation
- Check network connectivity and server response
- Refresh the page and restart the validation if necessary
