# Frontend - EvalDossiers

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.1.7.

## Development Server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is started, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

To get a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Build

To build the project, run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running Unit Tests

To run unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running End-to-End Tests

For end-to-end (e2e) tests, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not provide a default end-to-end testing framework. You can choose the one that best suits your needs.

## Dependencies

Make sure to install all necessary dependencies before starting the project. Run:

```bash
npm install
```
